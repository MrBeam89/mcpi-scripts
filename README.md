## MCPi Spy+
Requires MCPI-Addons (credits to Bigjango13), check it out [here](https://github.com/Bigjango13/MCPI-Addons)!


An enhanced version of the original MCPi Spy, uses usernames instead of player IDs,
making it easier and more practical to use.
Added support for spying specific X, Y, Z coordinates


Might add new stuff sooner or later...
